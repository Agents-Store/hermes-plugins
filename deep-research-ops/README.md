# deep-research-ops (Hermes Agent plugin)

Deep Research plugin. Comprehensive web research using 4 providers (Exa, Firecrawl, Jina, Perplexity) with capability-based CONNECTORS pattern and automatic FALLBACK chains. Search, scrape, crawl, extract — each action tries multiple providers until one succeeds.
